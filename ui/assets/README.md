# UI Assets for Mavric PM Co-Pilot

Place logo files in this folder if you want the Streamlit UI to show real brand logos
instead of generic emojis in the pipeline header.

Expected filenames:

- `config.png`   – Any generic settings/gear icon (optional)
- `meetgeek.png` – MeetGeek logo
- `gemini.png`   – Google Gemini logo
- `jira.png`     – Jira logo
- `slack.png`    – Slack logo

**Instructions**

1. Download the official PNG logos for each service (observe each vendor's brand guidelines).
2. Save them into this folder with the exact filenames above.
3. Reload the Streamlit app (or refresh the browser tab).

If a specific file is missing, the UI will automatically fall back to an emoji icon
for that service, so the dashboard still works without any assets present.
